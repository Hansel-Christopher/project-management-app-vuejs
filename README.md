# Task Management Application using Vue.js

A task managment board app built using Vue.js (Trello, JIRA style) for a project during my course. 
I've added features such as user authentication system, assigning members and made some UX improvements apart from those covered in the tutorial.

Followed from the tutorial by techlab23 [Article Link](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/task-management-application-using-vue-js-part-1-df607ca30f48?gi=c51e20fc8189).
